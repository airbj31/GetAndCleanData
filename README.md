# Running of the code.

1. download the [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/airbj31/GetAndCleanData/blob/master/analysis.R) into your working directory.

2. source("run_analysis.R") to download andy tidify data.

   two dataset will be generated by the run_analysis.R
   
   - **tidyGalaxy** : first data set.
   - **tidyGalaxySummary** : second, summarized dataset.this is the output of the run_analysis.R
 
   beside of the output, the script generate two function.
   
   - **merge3DF(file1,file2,file3)** : used to merge 3 dataset.
   - **num2act(x)** from the input of digit variable x, it redirect vector value which is human readable activity.
